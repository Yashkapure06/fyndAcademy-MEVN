### `Difference Between div, span, section, article`
<center style="text-align:justify">

| div | span | section | article |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|The `<div>` tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.|The `<span>` tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. |The `<section>` tag defines a section in a document. |The `<article>` tag specifies independent, self-contained content. |
|The `<div>` tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.|The `<span>` tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. | - | An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.|
|The `<div>` tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.|The `<span>` tag is much like the `<div>` element, but `<div>` is a block-level element and `<span>` is an inline element. | - | The `<article>` element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the `<article>` element|
