### Introduction to JavaScript 

* Introduction to Arrays

* Arrays in JavaScript:

        * An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
        * If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

                var car1 = "Saab";
                var car2 = "Volvo";
                var car3 = "BMW";

        * However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

        * The solution is an array!

        * An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
