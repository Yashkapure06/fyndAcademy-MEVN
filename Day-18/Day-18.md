### Introduction to JavaScript 

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

* closure
* functionHoisting
* lexical Scoping
* vairable hoisting

* closure: 
        * A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created. In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

* functionHoisting:
        * Function declarations are hoisted in JavaScript. This means that it is possible to call a function before it has been declared. This is because the function declaration is “hoisted” or moved to the top of the current scope. Function declarations are hoisted to the top of the current scope, which is either the enclosing function or, for functions declared outside any function, global.

* lexical Scoping:      
        * Lexical scoping is a way to determine how a variable is available for use in nested functions. It uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. Nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope.

* vairable hoisting:    
        * Variable declarations are processed before any code is executed. In other words, any variable can appear to be used before it has been declared. This is because all variable declarations (and not initializations) are “hoisted” to the top of the current scope. Variable declarations are hoisted to the top of the current scope, which is either the enclosing function or, for variables declared outside any function, global.
