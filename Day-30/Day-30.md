### Introduction to JavaScript 

* Regular Expressions means:
        * A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
        * When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.
        * A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.
        * Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.
        * Regular expressions are also used to validate form input, to manipulate text, such as to change the case of text, or to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.
        * Regular expressions are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String.
        * This section describes JavaScript regular expressions.
