* events:
        * An event is a signal that something has happened. Every DOM node contains a set of events which are triggered by user actions (such as mouse clicks, form submissions, etc.) or browser actions (such as page loading). You can register a function to be called whenever a particular event is triggered. This is called an event listener.
        * The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element. The event handler is executed when the event is triggered. The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers.
        * The removeEventListener() method removes an event handler that has been attached with the addEventListener() method. The removeEventListener() method removes an event handler from an element.
        * The EventTarget.addEventListener() method registers the specified listener on the EventTarget it's called on. The event target may be an Element in a Document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other object that supports events (such as XMLHttpRequest).
        * The EventTarget.removeEventListener() method removes an event listener from the EventTarget it's called on. The event target may be an Element in a Document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other object that supports events (such as XMLHttpRequest).
        * The EventTarget.dispatchEvent() method dispatches an event of the specified type at the target EventTarget. The event target may be an Element in a Document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other object that supports events (such as XMLHttpRequest).
        * The EventTarget.addEventListener() method registers the specified listener on the EventTarget it's called on. The event target may be an Element in a Document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other object that supports events (such as XMLHttpRequest).
        * The EventTarget.removeEventListener() method removes an event listener from the EventTarget it's called on. The event target may be an Element in a Document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other object that supports events (such as XMLHttpRequest).
        * The EventTarget.dispatchEvent() method dispatches an event of the specified type at the target EventTarget. The event target may be an Element in a Document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other object that supports events (such as XMLHttpRequest).
        * The EventTarget.addEventListener() method registers the specified listener on the EventTarget it's called on. The event target may be an Element in a Document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other

* objects:
        * An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.

* this:
        * The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used: In a method, this refers to the owner object. Alone, this refers to the global object. In a function, this refers to the global object. In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined. In an event, this refers to the element that received the event. Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.
