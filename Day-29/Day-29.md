### Introduction to JavaScript 

* DOM( Document Object Model):

        
        * The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
        
        * The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.
        
        * Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.
        
        * DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document's structure, style, or content.
        
        * DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
        
        * The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
                * Core DOM - standard model for all document types
                * XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
                * HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents
        
        * The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:
                * The HTML elements as objects
                * The properties of all HTML elements
                * The methods to access all HTML elements
                * The events for all HTML elements
        
        * In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
