        //sort
        //The sort() method sorts the items of an array.
        //The sort order can be either alphabetic or numeric, and either ascending (up) or descending (down).
        //By default, the sort() method sorts the values as strings in alphabetical and ascending order.
        //This works well for strings ("Apple" comes before "Banana").
        //However, if numbers are sorted as strings, "25" is bigger than "100", because "2" is bigger than "1".
        //Because of this, the sort() method will produce an incorrect result when sorting numbers.
        //You can fix this by providing a "compare function"
